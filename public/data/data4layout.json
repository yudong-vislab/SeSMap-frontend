    "paragraph_info": "Abstract— The spatial time series generated by city sensors allow us to observe urban phenomena like environmental pollution and traffic congestion at an unprecedented scale. However, recovering causal relations from these observations to explain the sources of urban phenomena remains a challenging task because these causal relations tend to be time- varying and demand proper time series partitioning for effective analyses. The prior approaches extract one causal graph given long- time observations, which cannot be directly applied to capturing, interpreting, and validating dynamic urban causality. This paper presents Compass, a novel visual analytics approach for in- depth analyses of the dynamic causality in urban time series. To develop Compass, we identify and address three challenges: detecting urban causality, interpreting dynamic causal relations, and unveiling suspicious causal relations. First, multiple causal graphs over time among urban time series are obtained with a causal detection framework extended from the Granger causality test. Then, a dynamic causal graph visualization is designed to reveal the time- varying causal relations across these causal graphs and facilitate the exploration of the graphs along the time. Finally, a tailored multi- dimensional visualization is developed to support the identification of spurious causal relations, thereby improving the reliability of causal analyses. The effectiveness of Compass is evaluated with two case studies conducted on the real- world urban datasets, including the air pollution and traffic speed datasets, and positive feedback was received from domain experts.",

For the first challenge, we propose a causal detection framework by extending the Granger causality test. This framework includes neighbor index, time partition, and debounce strategies to improve the capability of the causality test for urban time series. For the second challenge, we design a dynamic graph visualization to reveal the temporal variation of the detected causal relations and enable time- oriented drill- down analyses of causal graphs. For the third challenge, we consider the multiple dimensions of causal relations and propose a tailored visualization to expose causality suspiciousness. Finally, two real- world case studies on air pollution and traffic speed datasets, respectively, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. In sum, our contributions are as follows:",

In this way, the spatial complexity of causality can be reduced, and analysts can easily focus on the target areas of their interests. As for the time dimension, the time is properly partitioned into windows to reveal dynamic causalities. Causal detection works given an ego sensor and partitioned windows.",

We have created an alternative design using juxtaposed node- link diagrams (Fig. 7a- 1). However, all edges are connected to the red node (i.e., the ego sensor), causing visual clutter. The variations of the causal directions cannot be easily revealed. We have also created an alternative (Fig. 7a- 2). Each row represents a neighbor sensor or its causal relations with the ego sensor. Each rectangle is divided into two parts to indicate the opposite directions. Although the causal relations are revealed without clutter, the spatial structures are still lost. We enhance this design and derive our final design (Fig. 1c) by using the compass glyphs and adding the heatmaps and the minimaps.",

The framework slices the time span and captures reliable correlation relations between ST series in each time slice. Afterward, it employs a network formulation to fuse the correlation relations above and the spatial proximity in a semantic- preserving way and detect communities as evolution patterns. Consequently, the Storyline layout algorithm can be applied by considering each ST series as an entity and considering an evolution pattern as a session. For the second challenge, GeoChron supports a novel two- level visualization mechanism to present the spatiotemporal information of large- scale ST series. At the first level, we revise the Storyline with new interactions and visual encodings, and link it with a geographic map, to present evolution patterns from a high level of perspective. At the second level, we employ an EvoLens, a lens placed on the Storyline, to display more details regarding the temporal trends of evolution patterns in a narrative- preserving manner. The map is coordinated with the EvoLens to provide the detailed spatial context of evolution patterns. GeoChron is comprehensively evaluated by a series of studies and analyses. In sum, our contributions are as follows:",

[24] derived and visualized variations in recorded climate data to discern climate changes. Clustering can also help summarize ST series [60]. The ST series of the same cluster can be visually summarized by a representative one because they are similar [74]. Yet, existing methods treated spatial and temporal dimensions separately [60] and thus cannot capture the spatiotemporal relationship that shifts in both time and space. Besides, considering the whole time span may ignore local features. To this end, the sliding window strategy is helpful [1, 40]. A window slides along time, and its size is far less than the series' length. Clustering is performed on the parts of time series covered by the window.",

We define the evolution pattern in ST series and develop a framework to detect the patterns. Visualizing these patterns over time can retain the temporal trends of ST series.

Fig. 9A shows a snapshot of the result. The nearly vertical curves bounce up and down on the screen, resulting in visual distractions. Moreover, some aligned sessions are meant to be visually continuous, but this continuity is broken by these curves (e.g., Fig. 9B). Smaller the  $th_w$ , the less clutter. Second, we directly use the correlation coefficients in time slices rather than sliding windows and generate the layout in Fig. 9C with the same parameters in the first case ( $th_s = 7$  and  $th_c = 3$ ). We remove the gradient shade and focus on the layout. Compared with the time window- based results in Fig. 5D, the correlation relationship between ST series is more dynamic. In particular, the dashed ellipses in Fig. 9D and E highlight the unexpected deviation of curves. Entities part suddenly and come back together again, which may be due to the slightly offset time slices, subtle pollution events, or errors. Such deviations lead to visual clusters and prevent users from locating prominent visual patterns. It can be concluded that the sliding window does improve the readability of representations.",

Taking the space- time volume in Figure 2B as an example, there is a  $3\\times 3$  grid (i.e.,  $m = n = 3$ ) in the geographic space and 3 timestamps (i.e.,  $T = 3$ ), resulting  $3\\times 3\\times 3$  samples or voxels in total. The voxels colored pink denote  $\\nu^{(1,3, - )}$ .",

Each cell is of uniform size and sufficiently small. For example, the geographic space in Figure 2A is divided into a  $3\\times 3$  grid with 9 cells. Second, we divide the ST series with  $T$  timestamps by their timestamps into  $T$  slices. For the  $t$ -th slice of the  $t$  timestamp,  $t\\leq T$ , there are observed data samples  $Z_{t} = {z_{1,t},z_{2,t},\\ldots ,z_{ST}}$ , with  $z_{i,t} = v_{i,t}$  representing the value of the  $i$ -th series at timestamp  $t$ . Afterwards, interpolation techniques, like Kriging and Inverse Distance Weighted, can be employed to predict  $\\hat{z}{c{x,y}}$  for each grid  $c_{x,y}\\in C$  based on observed data samples  $Z_{t}$ , generating a sample  $(s = (x,y),t,v = \\hat{z}{c{x,y}})$  in the spacetime volume.

Particularly, the visualization based on the space-time cube enables users to directly map temporal trends to geographic space, facilitating space-oriented analysis. Moreover, VolumeSTCube does not require the trial-and-error parameter adjustment process, allowing for the direct revelation of spatiotemporal patterns through spatial and temporal integrated presentations.",

The unsteadiness of the flame can be present locally or globally in supersonic combustion, for instance, reactant mixing, ignition, flame stabilization, and blow-off. Thus, unsteady supersonic combustion is an urgent problem that needs to be solved for real scramjet engine applications. This work helps to advance the knowledge of dual-mode scramjet combustion operating with different equivalence ratios by conducting quantitative analyses that characterize flame dynamics under flow separation. A hydrogenfueled direct-injection scheme was computed using *blastFoam* code via large-eddy simulation of a scramjet test rig at a stagnation temperature of 950 K and a pressure of 0.82 MPa. The computational results were in good agreement with the experimental data, and two typical flame structures (cavity shear-layer and cavity assisted jet-wake stabilized flame) corresponding to the scram/ram operating modes were reproduced. The local flame structure and flow regime were investigated using a modified flame index and filter functions. A particular focus was set on the continuous flame flashback during mode transition, which could be divided into three stages involving jet/shear-layer interaction, unsteady heat release, and the establishment of a large-area separation zone, with the decay of the cavity recirculation zone. Additionally, the unsteady jet-wake ram combustion presented three oscillation modes, giving rise to intermittent flameout of varying levels. The coherent-structures motion caused by the combined effects of low-speed separated flow and the fuel-jet was the main cause for this kind of unsteady combustion.",

[\\[22](#page-11-0)] also noticed low-frequency heat release and pressure oscillations and attributed them to the periodic fluctuation of jet penetration brought on by the interaction with the shear layer. In a DMSJ engine, intensive heat release will alter the inflow conditions through the large-scale flow separation induced by upstream-propagating backpressure, which in turn modulates the flame stability downstream [\\[23\\]](#page-11-0). The possible interaction with fuel jets complicates the instability process even more. According to a series of well-known studies [\\[5,9,24,25\\]](#page-11-0), once the heat release reached a high enough level, there was a noticeable unsteadiness. Wang et al. [\\[26\\]](#page-11-0) experimentally studied the oscillation features of shock-train structures in an isolator with a choked throat, and found that the shock-train oscillation could propagate further downstream along the thicker boundary layer, resulting in drastic coherence and pressure fluctuations in downstream separated flow. Fotia et al. [\\[18](#page-11-0)] carried out an experimental study on the hydrogen-fueled DMSJ engine and observed some low-frequency periodic oscillations of the flame position under the separated flow, which could be correlated with the upstream unsteady pre-combustion shock-train.",

The recirculation ratio in the corner recirculation zone (1.5%) is lower than that in the separation zone (2%), although it is higher than that in case 1 at the same location.",

It is convincing that the most energetic POM (mode #1) is in close proximity to the dominant flame mode. Similar consistency is also observed in the lower-frequency modes. The spatial structures of the first three POMs are depicted in Fig. 15(b). In mode #1, the rapid exchange of momentum generates a pair of counter-rotating vortices when the high-speed jet penetrates the low-speed separated flow. The upstream vortex, which directly interacts with the fuel jet, explains the periodic variation in the penetration depth of the jet, while the downstream vortex determines the oscillation characteristics of the flame. In mode #2, a similar but larger counter-rotating vortex pair is generated, and the upstream vortex extends to the tail of the isolator. Mode #3 embodies the coherent structures that are related to the largest-amplitude flame oscillation. A single large vortex can be observed at the cavity exit, which occupies the entire height and entrains the flame into the cavity floor, consistent with the previous analyses. The vortex is generated by the sudden contraction of the channel when entering the expansion section. Therefore, it is expected that low-frequency oscillations of this kind can be suppressed by optimizing the dimensional parameters of the combustor.",

Existing models often struggle to capture the intricate data relationships, layout dependencies, and intertrack interactions that characterize these specialized charts. As noted by Cui et al. LLMs frequently fail to retain contextual detail or integrate intermediate-level signals when processing long input sequences. In genomic visualization scenarios, these limitations lead to the omission of key features, incomplete logic, and the generation of erroneous code, especially when dealing with multitrack genome layouts or multiomics data integration.",

Various visualization recommendation methods have been proposed to simplify this process, typically falling into two categories: rule-based and machine learning (ML)-based methods [ZSJ*20]. Rule-based methods rely on expert-defined heuristic rules to recommend visualizations [MHS07, WMA*15, WQM*17]. For example, GenoREC [PLW*22] recommends genomics visualizations based on the user-uploaded data and selected parameters. However, its rigid rules limit the types of data and tasks it can accommodate, making it challenging to adapt to diverse scenarios. Additionally, developing comprehensive rules for recommending circos plots is a challenging task [ZLQW24].",

We utilized example data from CircosJS [Koc16], which includes track data for plotting alongside chromosomes, label data for annotation elements in different tracks, and link data to establish connections between pairs of genomic regions. This dataset meets the requirements of circos plots, including relationships and multi-layered annotations across various scales [Krz09], and its manageable size ensured the study did not last for too long.",

First, Circos lacks design recommendations tailored to users' specific requirements or references for similar needs, making stages (a) and (b) both challenging and time-consuming.

First, Circos lacks design recommendations tailored to users' specific requirements or references for similar needs, making stages (a) and (b) both challenging and time-consuming. Second, implementing designs through configuration is cumbersome, particularly for novice designers, as Circos has a steep learning curve. Third, Circos does not properly support the iterative process of creating circos plots, leading to frequent trial and error. As  $\\mathrm{P}_2$  mentioned, \"While the process of using Circos can gradually optimize my design, it's too cumbersome.\"",
